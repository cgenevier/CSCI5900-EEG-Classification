# Band-Pass & Notch Filtering
# Rereference (ex: Common Average Reference)
# Downsampling
# Independent Component Analysis (ICA)

# Explicit Variants:
# 1. Minimal / conservative ERP pipeline
#    band-pass: 0.1–30 Hz
#    reference: common average
#    resample: 256 Hz
#    (no notch)
#    (no ICA)
# 2. Slightly more aggressive
#    band-pass: 0.3–30 Hz
#   reference: common average
#   resample: 256 Hz
